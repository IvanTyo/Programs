      <h1>Introduction.</h1>

      <p>Some years ago, I was defending capitalism in a discussion with a prominent professor of philosophy.
        In answer to his charge that capitalism leads to coercive monopolies, I explained that such monopolies
        are caused by government intervention in the economy and are logically impossible under capitalism.
        (For a discussion of this issue, see
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism:_The_Unknown_Ideal">Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal.</a>)
      </p>
        <p>The professor was singularly unmoved by my argument, replying, with a show of surprise and disdain:
          “Logically impossible? Of course — granted your definitions. You’re merely saying that, no matter what proportion
          of the market it controls, you won’t call a business a ‘coercive monopoly’ if it occurs in a system you call ‘capitalism.’
          Your view is true by arbitrary fiat, it’s a matter of semantics, it’s logically true but not factually true.
          Leave logic aside now; be serious and consider the actual empirical facts on this matter.”
          To the philosophically uninitiated, this response will be baffling. Yet they meet its equivalents everywhere today. The tenets
          underlying it permeate our intellectual atmosphere like the germs of an epistemological black plague waiting to infect and
          cut down any idea that claims the support of conclusive logical argumentation, a plague that spreads subjectivism and conceptual
          devastation in its wake.<img src= "http://www.maxmednik.com/uploads/3/7/5/4/3754834/2117959.jpg?135" width="100" align = "right"></p>

          This plague is a formal theory in technical philosophy; it is called: the analytic-synthetic dichotomy. It is accepted,
          in some form, by virtually every influential contemporary philosopher — pragmatist, logical positivist, analyst and existentialist alike.
          The theory of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy penetrates every corner of our culture, reaching, directly or indirectly, into every human life,
          issue and concern. Its carriers are many, its forms subtly diverse, its basic causes complex and hidden — and its early symptoms prosaic and
          seemingly benign. But it is deadly. </p>

          <p>The comparison to a plague is not, however, fully exact. A plague attacks man’s body, not his conceptual faculty. And it is
            not launched by the profession paid to protect men from it. Today, each man must be his own intellectual protector.
            In whatever guise the theory of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy confronts him, he must be able to detect it, to understand it,
            and to answer it. Only thus can he withstand the onslaught and remain epistemologically untouched.</p>

                <p>The theory in question is not a philosophical primary; one’s position on it,
                whether it be agreement or opposition, derives in substantial part, from one’s
                view of the nature of concepts. The Objectivist theory of concepts is presented
                above, in Ayn Rand’s Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology. In the present
                discussion, I shall build on this foundation. I shall summarize the theory of
                the analytic-synthetic dichotomy as it would be expounded by its contemporary
                advocates, and then answer it point by point.</p>

              <div class="column">
                <p>The theory was originated, by implication, in the ancient world, with the
                views of Pythagoras and Plato, but it achieved real prominence and enduring
                influence only after its advocacy by such modern philosophers as Hobbes, Leibniz,
                Hume and Kant. (The theory was given its present name by Kant.) In its dominant
                contemporary form, the theory states that there is a fundamental cleavage in
                human knowledge, which divides propositions or truths into mutually exclusive
                (and jointly exhaustive) types. These types differ, it is claimed, in their
                origins, their referents, their cognitive status, and the means by which they
                are validated. In particular, four central points of difference are alleged to
                distinguish the two types.</p>

              <div class="column">
                <p>The first proposition in each of these pairs, it is said, can be validated
                merely by an analysis of the meaning of its constituent concepts (thus, these
                are called “analytic” truths). If one merely specifies the definitions of the
                relevant concepts in any of these propositions, and then applies the laws of
                logic, one can see that the truth of the proposition follows directly, and
                that to deny it would be to endorse a logical contradiction. Hence, these
                are also called “logical truths,” meaning that they can be validated merely
                by correctly applying the laws of logic.</p>
